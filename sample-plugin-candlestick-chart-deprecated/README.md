# Getting Started with Sigma Plugins

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

&nbsp;

## Running This React App

If this is your first time running this app, navigate to the project directory and run the following command via your terminal:

### `yarn`

- Installs all necessary dependencies.

- You may skip this step if you have already run this command for this app previously.

After this, while still in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

- Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Using This App as a Sigma Plugin

1. Start off by creating a new workbook or opening an existing workbook. Make sure that your workbook has a data table in it that the plugin can read from. NOTE: For this specific plugin, you must make sure that the dates in the table are in ascending order.

2. Open the "Add element..." tab in the sidebar and add a Plugin (under "UI Elements").

3. Select the "Sigma Plugin Dev Playground" plugin, which plugin developers should have access to. Please contact your Organization Administrator if you cannot find this.

4. Select your source data table by selecting it in the "Select..." dropdown menu

5. Select the columns of your table containing the data for the Date, High, Low, Open, and Close values by clicking on the "+" symbol next to these categories and then selecting the columns you want to use from your source data table.
